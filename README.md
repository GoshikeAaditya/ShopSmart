ShopSmart is a versatile Python project designed to streamline product management for e-commerce platforms. Its primary use is to create, manage, and interact with a MySQL database that stores detailed product information, making it ideal for businesses or developers looking to organize and retrieve product data efficiently. The project automatically sets up a database and a products table with a comprehensive schema, including fields for product name, brand, category, price, weight, ingredients, allergens, nutritional information, and availability. Key functionalities include inserting initial product data, adding new products dynamically, and searching for products by their unique ID using Pandas for structured data retrieval. This makes ShopSmart a practical tool for managing inventory, querying product details, and ensuring data consistency in an e-commerce environment. Major highlights include its error handling for database integrity, support for multiple currencies and units, and the ability to handle complex product attributes, making it a robust solution for product data management.
